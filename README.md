# Liquid Data matrix
The liquid data Matrix allows ai to take in and understand arbitrary data by using a liquid data vector and arbitrary inferrence to abstract useful arbitrary data

i used ai to make the program yes(deepseek and gpt)
but i came up with the concept when i misunderstood how lnns work either that or it was a dream- i dont fully know..

either way i pushed forward because of my inferred knowledge that reality is arbitrary and darwins uncertainty principle(i would later go onto learn) essentially if you blur the information it becomes general and what other way can you do it than a classic gradeschool game of telephone between 2 ai friends, with a whiteboard seems like a fitting analogy here..

y_out = ψ_read( W_read2 · ψ_read( W_read1 · h_lat + b_read1 ) + b_read2 )
h_lat = φ_write( W_write2 · φ_write( W_write1 · x_in + b_write1 ) + b_write2 )

this is the equation if you dont trust my code just plug that into chat gpt and ask it what that does
(no its not an autoencoder though it looks like one, it uses an arbitrary latant space to store 4d - 1d information


it has a liquid data matrix that perceptrons encode and infer arbitrary data from any form of structured input/s in existance

it is to my knowledge nobody has tried this

Heres a link to my pre prof of conept theories, apologies for the lack of legibility
