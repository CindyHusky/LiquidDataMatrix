# Liquid Data matrix
The liquid data Matrix allows ai to take in and understand arbitrary data by using a liquid evolving data vector and arbitrary inferrence to abstract useful arbitrary data!

I used ai to make the program yes(Deepseek and GPT)
but i came up with the concept when i misunderstood how lnns work either that or it was a dream- i dont remember, maybe it was a bit of both its been a minute since..

Either way i pushed forward because of my inferred knowledge that reality is arbitrary, and Hiesenburg uncertainty principle(I would later go onto learn :/..) essentially if you blur the information it becomes more general, and what other way can you do it than a classic gradeschool game of telephone, 2 AI friends with a whiteboard seems like a fitting analogy here.
(no its not an autoencoder though it looks like one, it uses an arbitrary latant evolving space to store 4d - 1d information).

It is to my knowledge nobody has tried this!! :)

Heres a link to my pre proof of concept theories, apologies for the lack of legibility...


UPDATE: I thought i accidentally reinvented RNNs when i had learned of their existance
but yall are dumb why arent you doing my thing and only changing the latent memory when the Y on the perceptron is above 0?
all this state stuff is completely unneccesary 
Also yall have batch and long term memory problems because you arent using radial blur on the activations within a large data matrix
