# Liquid Data matrix
The liquid data Matrix is an attempt at creating digital wetware

I used ai to make the prototypes in the legacy folder on github
and i came up with the concept when i misremembered/understood how LNNS work..

In my system essentially if you blur the information it becomes more generalised, like pictionary, 2 AI friends with a single whiteboard one always writes and one always interprets and they cant see eachother.(also you cant go below 0 because you cant draw with an eraser)
(its not an "autoencoder" though because those aren't modeled after literal neurons, this behaves entirely different read further to understand)

Heres a link to my pre proof of concept theories, youre just gonna have to make due with the doctors handwriting style


UPDATE: I thought i accidentally reinvented RNNs when i had learned of their existance

for some odd reason though none of them use my simple if y <= 0 then leave memory unchanged
yknow... how electricity works in the brain, what mf has heard of antienergy and thought it might work in simulating a peice of wetware thats **RELIANT ON ELECTRICITY** smh

all this state stuff is completely unneccesary 
Also yall have batch and long term memory problems because you arent using radial blur on the activations within a large data matrix

i have also added my Offical SRBLDM design blueprint as a attempt at a prototype agi kernal
